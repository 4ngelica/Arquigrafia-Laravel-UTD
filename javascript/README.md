# Javascript/Vue.js Modules

This is the Javascript/Vue.js modules inside Arquigrafia.

- You must have npm or yarn. And before working, run:
```bash
$ yarn install
```
- This libraries are using webpack, to bundle the multiples Javascript file into a one bundled file. To start webpack to reload changes:
```bash
$ yarn start

- Remember to keep packages in package.json updated. This will prevent deprecation changes.

- After all changes, remember to create your final javascript modules build:
